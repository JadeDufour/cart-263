Welcome to Sisyphus’ dentist cabinet! 
…

Sisyphus couldn’t keep on pushing his boulder for free forever, he too wanted to make some money to support his family. Growing sore from all this boulder pushing, Sisyphus got fed up and let his boulder roll off that stupid mountain once and for all, screw it. He then gathered all 12 Olympians (don’t ask me how he did that) and asked them if they could give him a second chance at life; something he could make a living out of and something that would valorize his superior mental capacities (because you know, pushing a big dumb rock up a hill isn’t exactly Ph.D worthy). 

The deliberation amongst the Gods was a stormy one; excruciating and laborious, one might say. The ground was trembling, the oceans were raging, volcanoes were erupting all over the globe. Aphrodite was crying, Persephone was yelling, Dionysos was drinking. It was pure chaos.  

Sisyphus’ fate was settled two weeks later by none other than Zeus himself, angrier than ever at Sisyphus for having the guts to ask the Gods for a better sentence. Having already ordered Hades to chain Sisyphus down below in Tartarus a couple of centuries ago, the great God of lightning decided to go with a new kind of punishment this time. Modern problems requiring modern solutions, Zeus opted for a similar maddening sanction: cleaning the same set of nasty teeth for eternity… without ever truly succeeding at it. 

Maybe Sisyphus should have kept his mouth shut and endured the never-ending boulder pushing punishment.  But he stood up for himself, even though it didn’t turn out well. 

There is no lesson to learn here, just enjoy this mini-game even though you can never win.

As for the design and implementation, I wanted to come up with a refreshed version of Sisyphus’ story. I thought about daily activities and how they could be adapted to a Greek myth. That’s when I came up with the teeth brushing idea: brushing teeth but never being able to make them shine since they keep on turning back to yellow. In itself, teeth brushing is a repetitive action (at least it should be if you aim for decent dental hygiene). I went with this idea because it allowed me to use various methods and functions we learned in class: .animate, dialogue boxes, effects , .each , .attr, etc. I had fun incorporating icons and colour and flexboxes to add to the overall style of the game. The music used in the main dialogue box only exists to add an annoying ambience, it grew on me and it added to the ‘’ dentist office vibe’’  so I decided to keep it. I also like the idea of having a non-functioning faucet: the water stops when the toothbrush goes underneath it). It kind of reminds me of Sisyphus’s story too, never being able to achieve what you strive for.
